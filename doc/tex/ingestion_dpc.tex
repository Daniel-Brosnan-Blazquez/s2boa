\section{Ingestion module for the REP\_OPDPC file}

This sections describes the ingestion module for inserting the \acrshort{dpc} processing analysis.

The associated ingestion processor is:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{s2boa.ingestions.ingestion\_dpc.ingestion\_dpc}
  
\end{itemize}

This module uses the following \acrshort{dim} signatures:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{PROCESSING\_XXX}: data corresponding to the processing analysis.

\item \textbf{COMPLETENESS\_NPPF\_XXX}: data corresponding to the definition of planning completeness used for analysis.

\item \textbf{ISP\_VALIDITY\_PROCESSING\_COMPLETENESS\_XXX}: data corresponding to the definition of \acrshort{isp} processing completeness used for analysis.

\item \textbf{INDEXING\_XXX}: data corresponding to the indexing analysis of products.

\item \textbf{ARCHIVING}: data corresponding to the archiving analysis of products.

\item \textbf{CATALOGING}: data corresponding to the cataloging analysis of products.

\item \textbf{LONG\_TERM\_ARCHIVING}: data corresponding to the cataloging analysis of products.

\end{itemize}

Where XXX is the corresponding satellite id.

The figure \ref{fg:structure_ingestion_dpc_events} shows a simplified diagram of the structure of events inserted (associated structure of values not included for simplicity).
