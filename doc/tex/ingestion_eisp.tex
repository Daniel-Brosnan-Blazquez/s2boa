\section{Ingestion module for the REP\_PASS\_E file}

This sections describes the ingestion module for inserting the \acrshort{efep} acquisition analysis after reception of data from the satellite.

The associated ingestion processor is:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{s2boa.ingestions.ingestion\_edrs\_acquisition.ingestion\_edrs\_acquisition}

\item \textbf{s2boa.ingestions.ingestion\_vgs\_acquisition.ingestion\_vgs\_acquisition}
  
\end{itemize}

This module uses the following \acrshort{dim} signatures:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{RECEPTION\_XXX}: data corresponding to the acquisition analysis after reception of data from the satellite.

\item \textbf{COMPLETENESS\_NPPF\_XXX}: data corresponding to the definition of planning completeness used for analysis.

\item \textbf{ISP\_VALIDITY\_PROCESSING\_COMPLETENESS\_XXX}: data corresponding to the definition of \acrshort{isp} processing completeness used for analysis.

\end{itemize}

Where XXX is the corresponding satellite id, SSS is the station ID and VVV is the \acrshort{vcid} number.

The figure \ref{fg:structure_ingestion_eisp} shows a simplified diagram of the structure of events inserted (associated structure of values not included for simplicity).
