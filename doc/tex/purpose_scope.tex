\chapter{Purpose and scope}

The purpose of this document is to explain the tailoring done for \acrshort{s2}\acrshort{boa} component, which is based on \acrshort{boa} for monitoring the mission Sentinel-2. The scope will be limited to explain technically the tailoring.

\acrshort{s2}\acrshort{boa} uses \acrshort{boa}'s infrastructure to store the relevant data received from the external interfaces through the specific ingestion modules and allow its visualization through the specific views.

These are the available specific ingestion modules:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{ingestion\_nppf}: ingestion module for the planning received from the \acrshort{s2} Mission Planning

\item \textbf{ingestion\_orbpre}: ingestion module for the orbit prediction received from the flight dynamics

\item \textbf{ingestion\_station\_schedule}: ingestion module for the station schedule received from the \acrshort{s2} Mission Planning

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dfep\_schedule}: ingestion module for the \acrshort{dfep} schedule received from the \acrshort{s2} Mission Planning

\item \textbf{ingestion\_slot\_request\_edrs}: ingestion module for the \acrshort{edrs} planning received from the \acrshort{s2} Mission Planning

\item \textbf{ingestion\_station\_acquisition\_report}: ingestion module for the station acquisition report sent by the station operators

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dfep\_acquisition}: ingestion module for the acquisition analysis sent by the station

\item \textbf{ingestion\_edrs\_acquisition}: ingestion module for the \acrshort{edrs} acquisition analysis sent by the \acrshort{eisp}

\item \textbf{ingestion\_vgs\_acquisition}: ingestion module for the station acquisition analysis sent by the \acrshort{eisp}

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dpc}: ingestion module for the processing generation analysis sent by the processor

\item \textbf{ingestion\_ophktm}: ingestion module for inserting the production information of the package, which contains the housekeeping telemetry received from the satellite, generated by \acrshort{pdgs} to be sent to \acrshort{fos}

\item \textbf{ingestion\_rep\_arc}: ingestion module for the indexing of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_ai}: ingestion module for the archiving of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dc}: ingestion module for the circulation of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_lta}: ingestion module for the long-term-archive of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_ltas}: ingestion module for the long-term-archive of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dam}: ingestion module for the data access management of products

\item \textbf{ingestion\_dhus}: ingestion module for the data availability of products to users

\end{itemize}

These are the available specific views:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{Planning}: view for planning study

\item \textbf{\acrshort{tle} workflow}: view for the study of \acrshort{tle} circulation towards the expected destinations

\item \textbf{Tracking}: view for following the \acrshort{s2} constellation
  
\item \textbf{Acquisition}: view for acquisition performance from planning study

\item \textbf{\acrshort{hktm} workflow}: view for the study of \acrshort{hktm} circulation towards the expected destinations

\item \textbf{Data availability at \acrshort{dhus}}: view for the study of the dissemination of production towards \acrshort{dhus}

\item \textbf{Sensing data volumes}: view for the study of the volume of data, query driven by sensing timings

\item \textbf{Archive data volumes}: view for the study of the volume of data, query driven by archiving timings
  
\end{itemize}
