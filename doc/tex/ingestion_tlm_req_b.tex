\section{Ingestion module for the TLM\_REQ\_B\ files}

This section describes the ingestion module for inserting the telemetry files containing the memory information of the satellite.
The associated ingestion processor is 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{s2boa.ingestions.ingestion\_tlm\_req\_b.ingestion\_tlm\_req\_b}
\end{itemize}

This module uses the folowing \acrshort{dim} signatures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MEMORY\_EVOLUTION\_XXX}: data containing the evolution of the memory in the different storages (NOMINAL, NRT) for the two channels as well as the last replayed scene to ground for the two channels.
\end{itemize}

Where XXX is the corresponding satellite id.

The figure \ref{fig:structure_ingestion_tlm_req_b} shows a simplified diagram of the structure of events inserted (associated structure of values not included for simplicity).

The table \ref{tb:description_events_ingestion_tlm_req_b} shows the description of the events inserted by the ingestion module.
