\section{Ingestion module for the MPL\_ORBPRE file}

This sections describes the ingestion module for inserting the orbit prediction of the satellites generated by \acrshort{fos}.

The associated ingestion processor is:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{s2boa.ingestions.ingestion\_orbpre.ingestion\_orbpre}
  
\end{itemize}

This module uses the following \acrshort{dim} signatures:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{ORBPRE}: data corresponding to the orbit prediction of the satellites generated by \acrshort{fos} used for adjusting the timing of the planning events which are using the operations angle.

\item \textbf{CORRECTED\_NPPF\_XXX}: data corresponding to the planning of operations commanding the satellite corrected by the available orbit prediction data.

\item \textbf{COMPLETENESS\_NPPF\_XXX}: data corresponding to the definition of planning completeness used for analysis.
  
\end{itemize}

Where XXX is the corresponding satellite id.

The figure \ref{fg:structure_ingestion_orbpre} shows a simplified diagram of the structure of the data inserted (associated structure of values not included for simplicity).

Where YYY is the orbit number.

The table \ref{tb:description_events_ingestion_orbpre} shows the description of the events inserted by the ingestion.
